            Injuries in soccer, like most other sports, have a range of severity from a rolled ankle to torn ACL. 
          If an injury is accompanied by a popping sound in the joint, then a ligament or tendon in that joint was almost certainly torn. 
          A cracking sound usually means a broken bone. 
          Even though most pain is just a bruise that will heal in a week or two, if you are experiencing persistent pain you should go to the doctor. 
          We’ve all tried to ignore our injuries and paid the price. 
          Do as we say and not as we do! 
          In all seriousness, however, there are a lot of injuries that really shouldn’t be ignored, and if you do, you could keep paying for that mistake for the rest of your life. 
          Especially head injuries- if there are any injuries that you should be especially aware of, it’s head injuries. 
          Even one concussion puts you at higher risk of neurodegenerative illness, and more than one can cause permanent brain damage. 
          You can live a life with one knee or shoulder that doesn’t work quite right, it’s a lot harder if you have brain damage.

        <h2>The top ten most common soccer injuries are (in no particular order):</h2>
        <p2>
            1) Concussions
Concussions, or mild traumatic brain injuries, usually occur in soccer as a result of headers (purposeful or accidental), hitting your head on the goal, the ground, or another player, and the rare instance of being kicked in the head. Symptoms of concussions are confusion, dizziness, headaches, seeing spots, vision blurriness, nausea, and loss of peripheral vision. Concussions are also one of the more severe injuries in soccer, so if you even SUSPECT someone has a concussion, DO NOT LET THEM PLAY. Even if they would have scored a goal, it’s not worth the brain damage. Repeated concussions can end with permanent brain damage and loss of some brain function, so take them seriously. 
2) Achilles tendon injuries
          The Achilles tendon has a few possible injuries; it can have tendinitis and get sprained or torn. 
          Tendinitis is when the tendon becomes some combination of swollen, inflamed, and irritated. 
          This can happen to any tendon, but is most common in the Achilles and patellar tendon for soccer players. 
          Tendinitis does not need immediate medical attention and can be treated with rest, elevation, and ice. 
          It is possible to play with tendinitis, some of my friends have, but they wore tape or prewrap on their knees for stability. 
          If you sprain or tear your Achilles, you should get immediate medical attention and don’t put weight on the injured appendage. 
          Surgery is needed for some of these, while others will heal with rest, ice, and elevation. 
          Symptoms of an Achilles injury are pain in the tendon that worsens during activity, swelling, thickening of the tendon, reduced range of motion, and bone spurs on the heel. 
          If you hear a popping sound in your heel, that can also mean the Achilles was torn. 
3) Muscle strains/sprains and pulled muscles
          A muscle strain can range from mild, can heal on its own, to a complete tear of the muscle/tendon that takes months to heal. 
          Most strains don’t need medical care and the best way to heal those is rest and icing. 
          More severe tears, though, will need medical attention. 
          A muscle sprain is an injury to the ligament and often happens with sudden twisting or changes of direction. 
          Symptoms of a sprain are pain, swelling, bruising, and limited range of motion. 
          Most of these can be treated the same way strains are, rest elevation, and icing. 
          However, if they keep hurting, you should see a doctor. 
          A pulled muscle is when you overstretch a muscle, the muscles that this happens to the most in soccer are the groin, hamstring, and calf. 
4) Shin splints
          Shin splints are an overuse injury, and occur when there is: a dramatic increase in the amount of running, insufficient rest and recovery between activities, improper footwear, or playing on hard surfaces (any activity with repetitive stress on the shinbone and surrounding muscles). 
          Symptoms of shin splints are: pain on the shinbone and/or outer edge of the shin, tenderness, and sometimes swelling. 
          Shin splints aren’t permanent, they can go away if you take proper care of them. 
          These are also not catastrophic, but can become an irritant or could stop one from playing if left untreated. 
5) ACL tear
          Even the words “torn ACL” are enough to make me (and a lot of other soccer players) shiver. 
          A torn ACL could be a career-ending injury, and is almost always at least season-ending. 
          A torn ACL is between 9-12 months of recovery if done correctly. 
          Megan Rapinoe is one famous soccer player who suffered two ACL injuries in a short time frame, and the second one was probably because she tried to recover from the first one in less than two months. 
          The second one, however, she took the time to recover from properly and did not tear that ACL again. 
          When I tore my ACL, it took me ten months to be able to play soccer again, and I stuck to my physical therapy almost religiously. 
          If you don’t do your physical therapy or skip it occasionally; 1) the physical therapist will know, and 2) it will take longer to heal and you are more likely to retear it. 
          ACL tears, and knee injuries in general, are more likely to happen to women than men, but everyone should still do preventive exercises. 
          To avoid tearing your ACL, make sure to do leg strength exercises, like squats, and agility exercises, like ladders. 
          You can find how to do these exercises in the resources section, or other places online. 
6) Meniscus tear
          Meniscus tears occur in about 70% of ACL injuries, and occasionally on their own. 
          The meniscus is C-shaped cartilage in the knee and acts like a cushion between the tibia (shinbone) and femur (thighbone). 
          It’s the shock absorber of the knee! Meniscus injuries usually happen because of a forceful or sudden twist/rotation of the knee. 
          Some meniscus injuries can heal on their own, but others require surgery. 
          And, if you’ve torn the ACL, MCL, or LCL along with the meniscus, that’ll need surgery anyway. 
          To ease pain from a torn meniscus, icing and elevation will probably help, as will keeping off your feet. 
          Because the meniscus is the shock absorber of the knee, too much pressure on a torn one will hurt. 
          Symptoms of a torn meniscus include something feeling “off” in your knee, popping/cracking sounds, your knee locking in place, pain, and stiffness or swelling. 
7) Fractures
           Fractures, or broken bones, are pretty painful injuries. 
          There are multiple combinations of possible injuries with a broken bone. 
          It can be a closed/simple fracture (where the skin is intact) or an open/compound fracture (where the bone pokes through the skin), the bone can be broken in multiple places (segmental/comminuted fracture) or just one, or it can be a stable fracture (the ends are still in place), or not. 
          The break can be a horizontal line through the bone (transverse fracture) or angled/jagged line (oblique fracture). 
          It is also possible to have an avulsion fracture, or one where the bone attaches to tendons or ligaments. 
          How long these take to heal varies on the bone; wrist fractures might take as short as 4 weeks while a tibia fracture might take several months. 
          If you suspect you might have a broken bone, go to the doctor. 
          Hoping these heal on their own isn’t going to work. 
          I tried that once, and I had a hard time moving my arm for months. 
8) LCL/MCL tear
          The MCL and LCL are ligaments in your knee, just like the ACL. 
          However, "torn MCL" does not elicit the same "curl up in a ball feeling" as the words "torn ACL' do. 
          The MCL is the ligament on the inside of your knee, and the LCL is on the outside. 
          These are some of the more common knee injuries, and happen with sudden twisting/pivoting, or the knee being pushed out of alignment. 
          Symptoms of a tear or sprain of the MCL or LCL are similar to those of the ACL or meniscus, pain, swelling, stiffness, if the knee popped/cracked at the injury, and feelings of instability. 
          If you suspect you might have injured your MCL or LCL, it’ll likely be painful to walk on, but walking on it will probably not do any more damage to your knee. 
9) Cuts/Turf burn
          These, along with bruises, are the most ubiquitous injuries in soccer. 
          Soccer players rarely get cuts, and pretty much only from a misplaced cleat. 
          Turf burn is pretty similar to rug burn, and you get it from falling/sliding on the artificial turf. 
          (Turf, in case you don’t know, is synthetic grass used in a lot of playing fields. There is controversy surrounding turf, but I won’t go into that here). 
          Turf burn is usually pretty minor, but you should still be careful with it, because it can get infected. 
          My teammates and I wear our bruises and turf burn as badges of honor, because that meant we were putting in 100%. 
          Saying this, don’t go out and try to get bruises or turf burn, because that can lead to other, worse, injuries. 
10) Bruises
          Bruises are the very possibly the most common injury in soccer. 
          You’ve probably had at least one bruise before, so you know how this feels. 
          Bruises themselves usually don’t hurt, but they do if you touch them! 
          Bruises happen when a blood vessel is damaged under the skin, but there is no external bleeding. 
          Some bruises, especially ones on the shins or knees, might form a lump. 
          If this happens, don’t freak out, because bruises are basically a lump of blood under the skin. 
          In other places, like your arms, where there is more muscle, the bruise can push that back but not deform your arm. 
          When the bruise is on top of a bone, it can’t do that, so it pushes out the skin instead, forming a lump.
