        <h2>The World Cup</h2>
        <p2>
            The World Cup is soccer’s biggest tournament. 
            This is the trophy that proclaims “We are the best in the world!” and means it. 
            Other sports have their own tournaments, including World Cups for other sports, the Tour de France, and Wimbledon for tennis. 
            However, every single country in the world plays soccer. 
            You might protest that the US doesn’t, but we do. 
            There is a professional soccer league, MLS, in the US, and our national women’s team is currently on top of the world with their gold at the Olympics (as of 2025). 
            The difference is that soccer is the most popular sport in almost all countries, except the US. T
            he World Cup is held every four years (the men’s is in 2026 and the women’s is in 2027) in different countries. 
            A few countries have hosted multiple times, and some host jointly, like the US, Canada, and Mexico are hosting the men’s 2026 World Cup together. 
            Soccer is a very global sport, despite being dominated by Western Europe and South America for men and the US/Canada, Western Europe, and Japan for women, it is played all over the world. 
            Soccer is a way to communicate without talking, it can bridge borders. 
            That, to me, is part of what the global game is about. 
            That, and watching some high-quality soccer.

            There are a lot of wonderful books out there about the World Cup that I recommend you read, including:
How to Win the World Cup: Secrets and Insights from International Football’s Top Managers by Chris Evans
World Cup Nuggets: Everything You Need to Know About the World Cup by Richard Foster
Against All the Odds: The Greatest World Cup Upsets - a compilation of articles by various authors

        <h2>The Wall</h2>
        <p2>
            The wall is unique to soccer, so I just thought I’d take a few sentences and explain it. 
            When free kicks are awarded to the other team in your half, your team might set up a Wall. 
            This is usually organized by the goalkeeper, who will call out players to be in the wall (usually the tallest ones, or the ones you don’t need marking people somewhere else), and where the wall should stand. 
            The purpose of the Wall is to block one side of the goal, so the keeper only has to watch the other half. 
            This usually works, but in the pros, you will see players able to bend the ball over the opposing Wall and then down again to either get a shot on goal or set up a teammate for a shot. 
            This skill is extremely rare in non-professional soccer, so don’t get too excited (some excitement is fine, and even encouraged).
