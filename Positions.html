        <h1>Positioning in Soccer</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>The Basic Positions:</h2>
        <p2>
            There are four major positions in soccer: offense, midfield, defense, and the goalkeeper. 
            In the younger age groups, up to about 10-11 year olds, these are what the positions are called. 
            You might have an outside mid or a centerback, but for the most part, there will just be these four main ones. 
            These positions are eponymous: defenders defend the goal and the offense tries to score. 
            Middle schoolers will also have designated goalkeepers (if someone is willing to) and midfielders. 
            Goalkeepers are the one position where the player is allowed to use their hands, and are encouraged to. 
            Midfielders do both offense and defense, and often end up doing the most running in a game. 
            Forwards, or strikers, are the ones who score goals.

        <h2>The Responsibilites of Each Position:</h2>
        <p2>
            The responsibilities of each position are pretty self-explanatory. 
The main job goalkeepers have is to keep the ball out of the goal. 
Because they’re allowed to use their hands, keepers are encouraged to make dramatic, acrobatic saves. 
Keepers can also be used to distribute the ball out of the back, but not all teams do this, especially not younger kids. 
Professional defenders have two jobs: defend, and outside backs on some teams are also used in the attack. 
This depends on the coach, though, and some will want their defense to stay defensive, others want them to participate in the attack. 
This also depends on your individual defenders, like if you know the defenders are fast and can chase forwards down, then you will want them to be more involved in the attack. 
If they’re slower, then they might sit back more. 
Midfielders’ jobs are usually divided by position- wingers and attacking midfielders often operate like forwards, dribbling the ball and trying to score. 
They do usually have more assists than forwards, however. 
Defensive midfielders’ jobs are to stop the other team’s attack, and, when they get the ball, send it up and out to the wings. 
They can also score, but it’s less common. 
Forwards have one job: to score. 
A forward who doesn’t score often gets very little playing time. 
They can be deeper-lying, a forward who tries to win the ball themselves and can dribble and shoot from farther out, or they can receive the ball from a teammate and take it from there. Forwards are often good at making runs to throw off the opposing defense and get the ball. 
Each position on a team has its own responsibilities, but it is never only the keeper or the defense’s fault when a goal is scored, just like a goal never belongs only to the person who took the shot. 
Soccer is a team sport, and a single player doesn’t have an outsize effect on victories and losses, or Messi and Argentina would have won more World Cups.

        <h2>Specialty Positions:</h2>
        <p2>
            There are, as mentioned above, more specific versions of each position. 
            As players get older, they will pick a position or three that they like playing the best, "specializing" in these positions. 
            For example, my favorite position to play is the defensive midfielder, but I also enjoy outside back or centerback. 
            Because I play these positions, I can refer to myself as a defender or midfielder. 
            When playing with the 11 vs. 11 format that anyone U13 or older (if they have enough players) will use, a common way to refer to the positions is with numbers. 
            If you've ever watched soccer, this is what the announcers mean when they talk about the #9 (center striker) or #10(attacking midfielder).
