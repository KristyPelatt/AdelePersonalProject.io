        <h1>Positioning in Soccer</h1>

        <h2>The Basic Positions:</h2>
        <p2>
            There are four major positions in soccer: offense, midfield, defense, and the goalkeeper. 
            In the younger age groups, up to about 10-11 year olds, these are what the positions are called. 
            You might have an outside mid or a centerback, but for the most part, there will just be these four main ones. 
            These positions are eponymous: defenders defend the goal and the offense tries to score. 
            Middle schoolers will also have goalkeepers and midfielders. 
            Goalkeepers are the one position where the player is allowed to use their hands, and are encouraged to. 
            Midfielders do both offense and defense, and often end up doing the most running in a game.

        <h2>Specialty Positions:</h2>
        <p2>
            There are, as mentioned above, more specific versions of each position. 
            As players get older, they will pick a position or three that they like playing the best, "specializing" in these positions. 
            For example, my favorite position to play is the defensive midfielder, but I also enjoy outside back or centerback. 
            Because I play these positions, I can refer to myself as a defender or midfielder. 
            When playing with the 11 vs. 11 format that anyone U13 or older (if they have enough players) will use, a common way to refer to the positions is with numbers. 
            If you've ever watched soccer, this is what the announcers mean when they talk about the #9 (center striker) or #10(attacking midfielder).
