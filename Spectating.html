        <h1>Best Practices for Spectating</h1>

        <h2>Watching Kids' Games:</h2>
        <p2>
            If you‘re watching your kids play soccer, odds are they want you to watch attentively and cheer when appropriate. 
            Things that annoy/embarrass kids are: excessive cheering, cheering for teammates they don‘t like or you don‘t know, sideline coaching, yelling at them/their teammates/coach/the referees. 
            Some kids will want you to know what mistakes they made so you can help them improve, but they DO NOT want you to present these mistakes as criticism, insults, or in any other demeaning way. 
            This will make the kid dislike you and soccer, and odds are you don‘t want that. 
            If your kid does want you to tell them what you did wrong, use the Compliment Sandwich- a compliment, then the area of improvement, then another compliment. 
            Again, remember, these are kids- they are almost certainly not going to go pro, so just enjoy it.

        <h2>Watching Professional Games:</h2>
        <p2>
            In general, the same principle applies for watching professional soccer as kids’ soccer: only shout positive things at the players. 
            You can be disappointed with the players on your team, but only quietly. 
            Shouting negative things at people never makes them do better, but it will make them do worse. 
            The same goes for the referees- don’t insult them either. 
            They are under a lot of pressure to do their job well, and booing them does not make the job easier. 
            If referees are upset, they are more likely to give out cards, and nobody wants that.
