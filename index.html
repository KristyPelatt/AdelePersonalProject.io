        <h1>A Guide to Soccer For Novice Soccer Fans</h1>

        <h2>How Soccer Works:</h2>
        <br>
        <p2>Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. 
            It is the most popular sport in every country except the USA. 
            Because of that, I’ve made a little guide for any new fans who want to pick a sport for their kids, learn more about the beautiful game, or understand what some relatives (younger or otherwise) are talking about with soccer. 
            Soccer is the fastest growing youth sport in the US, so it’s likely that if you’re here, you want to either pick a sport for your kid, or you’ve already chosen soccer and want to know what you got yourself into. 
            Here, I’ll explain positioning, refereeing/fouls, some miscellaneous soccer information, and injuries in soccer. 
            If you’re looking for information in the youth soccer pipeline to the national team, there are plenty of other resources out there. 
            I don’t play in that pipeline, so I can’t offer much advice to players. 
            To parents, however, I do say this: let your kid choose if they want to go pro or not. 
            You can give them that opportunity, but don’t pressure them to play soccer. 
            I would always advocate for soccer, but I know it’s not for everyone. 
            Pressuring your kids to do something they don’t want to do is a sure way to cause strife in your family, and I certainly don’t think that’s fun.

            Now that that’s out of the way, here are some basics on soccer:
            1) You can’t use your hands. I know this sounds like a no-brainer, but I just thought I’d say it. 
            2) Soccer is a much lower-scoring game than American football or basketball, often going for the entire game with only one goal (or no goals), but that doesn’t mean it’s boring. 
            Some of the best games I’ve ever watched have been ties. 
            3) That being said, if you’re a casual fan and are just watching for the goals, you might find soccer boring. 
            However, if you want to take some time and dig into it a little bit, you’ll find soccer has a lot of other exciting things to watch for (an amazing save, anyone? No, still just me? Oh, well)
            4) The soccer field is huge compared to any other sport:

            5) You don’t need to be tall to be good at soccer. 
            Some of the best players I’ve known were 4’10”, 5’2”, and 5’0”. 
            I myself, at 5’4”, am one of the tallest players on my team. (We are a bit shorter than average, though)
            6) The objective, like most sports, is to score. 
            Soccer players do that by kicking the ball to each other or dribbling with their feet down the enormous field to shoot on the opposing team’s goal. 
            If you want an excellent description of this, the book by Ron Rhody in the Resources list is spectacular. 
            7) Soccer is a team sport. 
            Even though there might be one “best” player on your team, they can’t win the game for you. 
            Everyone has their own role on the team, and everyone is just as important as the next player. 
            If the best player made the team, Messi and Ronaldo would have won a lot more World Cups.
