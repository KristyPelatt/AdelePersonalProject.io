        <h1>What Is and Isn't a Foul</h1>

        <h2>Fouls:</h2>
        <p2>
            One of the things that everyone knows about soccer is that you can’t use your hands. 
            This is very true- it’s a foul if you touch the ball with your arm, but it’s also a foul if you elbow or shove your opponent, same as the ball! Other fouls include tripping opponents, using excessive force to win a ball, contact off the ball, contact with intent to injure the opponent, and wasting time. 
            These are all designed to keep soccer players safe and reduce injuries. 
            The penalty for time wasting is a yellow card, and is enforced when goalkeepers hold the ball for more than six seconds or when a player excessively celebrates their goal (i.e. taking off their shirt or a choreographed dance). 
            These are to keep the game moving and to limit the amount of extra time the referee needs to add. 
            Soccer players are allowed more contact with opponents than, say, basketball players, but aren’t allowed to full-on tackle opponents (like American football players). 
            Soccer players also have limited protective gear, so don’t be surprised if your young soccer player comes home sporting a bruise or two, especially from being stepped on at younger ages where kids aren’t as coordinated. 
            However, I was always very proud of these bruises, and the response I wanted was one where my parents were impressed and told me I did a good job. 
            Some kids will want a hug, others want you to be impressed, maybe both.

        <h2>Actions that aren't fouls but seem like they should be:</h2>
        <p2>
            Some things aren’t called very often, either because they’re an obscure rule or the referee plays the advantage- where there was a foul, but it didn’t disadvantage the fouled team/the fouled team kept the ball and are now on the attack, so the referee shouts “Play on!”. 
            Other things that aren't called a lot include delibarately impeding an opponent, or the six-second rule for goalkeepers. 
            While these might technically be fouls, they aren't always against the "spirit of the game". 
            These are also harder for the referee to notice. 
            Another thing is shoulder checking- where one player uses their shoulders to try to shove their opponent out of the way.
            This is usually legal, but some referees might call this as "excessive force", especially if you don't make contact with the ball.

        <h2>Actions that are fouls at some ages/levels, but not others:</h2>
        <p2>
            Younger kids have stricter regulations for what is allowed or not because they are smaller and more vulnerable to injury. 
            U12 players and younger are not allowed to head the ball, nor can they slide tackle. 
            Headers are treated as handballs and slide tackles are treated as tripping, and attempting either is a foul and results in a free kick. 
            U12 and younger players have these stricter restrictions to protect them from injury and so soccer isn't scary.
