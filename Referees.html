        <h2>Main Referee vs. Sideline Referee</h2>
        <p2>
            The main referee is the one on the field with the players. 
            The main referee’s calls are final and the players, fans, and sideline referees should not argue. 
            The main referee relies on the sideline referees to call offsides, throw-ins, and fouls the main referee might not be aware of. 
            The main referee calls most fouls, has the final authority on free kicks, goal kicks, and corner kicks, is the one who hands out cards, and keeps the score. 
            Sideline referees are equipped with a checkered flag they use to signal calls. 

            Referees, similar to players, wear cleats and shin guards. 
            They also have shorts/a shirt with pockets to keep the cards and score pad. 
            Soccer referees’ shirts are usually neon yellow, blue, or red, and their shorts are black. 
            These colors are to differentiate them from the players, who will be wearing differently colored, possibly even multicolored, shirts.

        <h2>How to Know What Call Is Being Made:</h2>
        <p2>
            Each call a referee makes has its own hand signal. 
            Sideline referees make these signals with flags, the main referee uses their hands. 
            This diagram is of the different flag positions for sideline referees:

        <h2>What to Say (And Not Say) to/about Referees:</h2>
        <p2>
            The referees are doing a very important job. 
            Without them, the game would not happen. 
            Referees make sure that players do not injure themselves or each other, so without them, we’d have a lot shorter careers for professional players. 
            Accordingly, you should be respectful and kind to the referees. 
            No matter what game you’re watching, do not shout insults at the referee, but especially if the game is small so the referee will certainly be able to hear you. 
            At the end of each of my games, every single player and coach thanks each referee for being there. 
            That is the spirit you want to have when talking to referees. 
            Remember, soccer is, in the end, just a game.
